There is a real SAS code Jupyter Notebook here:

~/SASUniversityEdition/myfolders/Backwards-Elimination-SAS-Macro-Real-Code.ipynb

The notebook should be in this directory because only there you can open the notebook using SAS.

The notebook:

Backwards-Elimination-SAS-Macro-Real-Code.ipynb

In this directory is only a recreation of the original paper. 

I'm using in my blog markeyser.com a lightly modified version of the real SAS code version of the notebook.

The same for the Forward selection case.
